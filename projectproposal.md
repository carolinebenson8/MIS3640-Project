# 4.1 Project Proposal
Due: 9/24

# The Big Idea: 
The main idea of this project is a domain compiler/aggregator for people who do yoga at all levels. The purpose of this compiler is to allow users to search anything they want to learn, read, and/or discover yoga in one domain/search engine. This would include instructional videos, clothing, and studios in the Wellesley area.

MVP- Yoga U

Our stretch goal is being able to compile data from all sources about yoga from beginner, intermediate, to advanced. 


# Learning Goals: 
We both share the goal of wanting to learn how to build a program catered to our interests while being able to help others also interested in this topic. We hope to have a solid understanding of python and program building by the end of this course and project.

# Implementation Plan: 
Researching/compiling specific data we want on our own
*unsure how we come up with the plan to get all of the information into one database*


# Project schedule: 
Week 1- Finalize the proposal
Week 2- Begin research
Week 3- Narrow down data gathered (5 local studios, 5 local clothing stores, 90 videos- 30 beginner, 30 intermediate, 30 advanced)
Week 4- Create video database 
Week 5- Create studio and clothing database/code
Week 6- Work on formatting/design
Week 7- Review/edit all code, database, work
Week 8- Project launch


# Collaboration plan: 
We plan to work on the majority of the project together. If there are any scheduling issues where we cannot meet together in person or over zoom, we will split up accordingly. We have worked together in the past, we have played on the lacrosse team together at Babson, we have years of experience working together. We are unsure what software development methodologies we are going to use, we plan to meet with you frequently about any questions, concerns, and advice you may have for us as we move forward. 

# Risks: 
The biggest risk we see to the success of our project is trying to add too much data in our segments. For example, trying to add more information about the studio than we need. We feel it would be important to include things like the class schedule but it might be difficult to include that in our code.  

# Additional Course Content: 
One of the most helpful topics we will cover is interface design. Not only is the coding very critical, but the design and aesthetic for the user is just as important. This program must be easy to navigate for any user. navigate and also seem like a reputable source.

Another helpful topic that will be further discussed is IO programming. We are not fully familiar with this topic as we have not covered it yet but based on reading about it in GitHub, we feel that it will be helpful towards the success of our project.
